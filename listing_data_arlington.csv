Earthen Cottage on Small Ecovillage,"***30 nights minimum stay***

This hand sculpted dwelling feels like an indigenous hut with comfy country furnishings. 

It is at the back of The Garden of Eden eco-village, a thriving small community dedicated to sustainability and philanthropy! With over 3 acres of land, wildcrafted gardens, and families living here, the vibe is wholesome and progressive. 

Enjoy the privacy of the secluded cottage, or join us on the grounds or in the main house for activities or communal meals by donation.

The Cob cottage is cozy and private, though it is rustic and quite simple. As part of our ecovillage culture, we are dedicated to living sustainably and the Cob cottage is a great showcase for that!

Cob is a mixture of sand, straw, clay, and water - this sweet little cottage is literally handmade out of Earth! It is a very peaceful and oh so unique place to stay :)

The insulating nature of cob is such that it stays a little warmer in winter and a bit cooler in summer. 

Electricity DOES run to the Cob house. It has a space heater in winter and a small AC unit for the summer months.

Wifi does not reach to the cottage in the back of our property, but you can come to the main house to connect.

There is a lock on the door for your privacy and comfort. We ask a  refundable $20 deposit for the key to the lock.

We will provide a reusable water bottle filled with filtered water in your space. You may refill this with filtered water from our kitchen and use for the duration of your stay so you don't have to go to the store and buy bottled water (which is not only poor quality water often no better than tap water, but is also packaged in disposable plastics that harm health and pollute the earth). If you would like to take the sustainable water bottle with you on your journey, they are available in exchange for a small donation.

We provide a complimentary continental breakfast for you with hot tea, seasonal fruits, a variety of organic milks & cereals, organic breads, and deliciou",,Private room in earthen home,Private room,Before 2021-09,2022-06-30,United States,Texas,Kennedale,76060,,"Dallas-Fort Worth-Arlington, TX",USD,54,1,1,4,,,f,strict_14_with_grace_period,,,20.0,20.0,10.0,10.0,,12:00 PM,30,32.62566,-97.19454,f,93,10,10,10,10,9,"['Hair dryer', 'Hot water', 'Shampoo', 'Essentials', 'Bed linens', 'Dryer', 'Extra pillows and blankets', 'Hangers', 'Iron', 'Washer', 'Baby monitor', 'Children’s books and toys', 'Pack ’n play/Travel crib', 'Air conditioning', 'Heating', 'Lock on bedroom door', 'Coffee maker', 'Cooking basics', 'Dishes and silverware', 'Kitchen', 'Backyard', 'Patio or balcony', 'Free parking on premises', 'Free street parking', 'Single level home', 'Breakfast', 'Long term stays allowed', 'Luggage dropoff allowed', 'Host greets you']",https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/55087718/754ba5d7_original.jpg?aki_policy=large,,4385691,22768891,"{""allows_children"": true, ""allows_infants"": true, ""allows_pets"": false, ""allows_smoking"": true, ""allows_events"": true, ""id"": 4385691, ""host_check_in_time_message"": """", ""localized_structured_house_rules_with_tips"": null, ""p3_structured_house_rules"": [""No pets"", ""Smoking is allowed""], ""structured_house_rules"": [""No pets"", ""Smoking is allowed""], ""structured_house_rules_with_tips"": [{""key"": ""are_pets_allowed_as_host"", ""long_term_text"": null, ""text"": ""No pets"", ""tip"": null, ""details"": null, ""airmoji_key"": ""house_rules_no_pets""}, {""key"": ""smoking_allowed_as_host"", ""long_term_text"": null, ""text"": ""Smoking is allowed"", ""tip"": null, ""details"": null, ""airmoji_key"": ""house_rules_yes_smoking""}], ""allows_non_china_users"": true}",0,False,https://airbnb.com/rooms/4385691,False,304,30,46,0.15,4,8,47,47,2242,2242

Better than a high-priced hotel!  You'll enjoy complete privacy, high-thread-count sheets, plush towels, a great mini-bar, individual A/C and space heater, and a CDC-recommended in-room HEPA air purifier which also minimizes allergy symptoms. Extra clean with sanitizing touches.

Your suite is completely  separate from the rest of the townhouse.  You'll have a private entrance from the front patio through the beautiful French doors.  No shared spaces.  
     The suite connects to the main house through the kitchenette.  The door remains closed and locked; there is even a chain to ensure your privacy.  Keeping the bedroom door closed will keep any noise from the main house from disturbing your stay.  I'm a pretty quiet person and am normally upstairs before 11:00.
     While I enjoy meeting my guests, in these days of social distancing, I am listening to the wisdom of the CDC and respecting the need for each of us to limit our contact with others.  Of course,  I can turn down the air, turn up the heat, turn on the light if it's dark, and let you know as soon as the room is clean and ready so you'll have access to the suite as early as possible.  I'll still be here to make sure you're as comfortable as possible.

I am currently working from home, and following social distancing guidelines. If you should need assistance, please reach out to me.

Uber is allowed in Arlington and recommended if you are limited on cars.

It's perfect for privacy of 2 couples.  Our property is on 1+acres, in the middle of Arlington.  We are 3.5 miles to the AT&T, Cowboys, and Globe Life Park.  We are 30 minutes to Dallas or  Ft Worth.  The bedrooms are large, the kitchen is stocked with the basics for coffee, cooking or baking.  There is a washer and dryer in the cottage.  We provide everything you need to enjoy your stay.   If there is something that we forgot - a simple text to us, should resolve the issue.   The cottage has its own private back patio, parking and front porch chairs for relaxing. The cottage has wifi, two flat screen tv's, a full size fridge, washer/ dryer.  Both bedrooms have queen mattresses.

I have stocked our guesthouse with all the amenities. The kitchen has everything you need: Dishes, pans, glass wear, cooler, coffee, creamer, sugar, ziplocks.  The bathroom is stocked with towels, kleenex, shampoo, conditioner and soap.  There is a private patio for our guest house and there is parking for two cars. One space is covered.    We have two TV's:  One in the front living room and one in the back bedroom. We have Directv and Roku or ChromeCast.  There is also a DVD player in the living room TV.  We also offer dedicated wifi network for our guest.     
Lastly, there is  a washer and dryer inside the guest house.

Our main home is also located on the 1+ acre property, but the location of the cottage allows you complete privacy.

We are located in central Arlington on a old pecan orchard.  The neighborhood is gorgeous and ideal for relaxing or taking walks on tree lined streets.

A Cozy Travel Trailer on Private EcoVillage Land,"***30 nights minimum stay***

This trailer is uniquely situated within The Garden of Eden eco-village, a thriving small community dedicated to sustainability and philanthropy! 

With over 3 acres of land, herb and vegetable gardens, wildcrafted foods and medicine, and a handful of residents living here, the vibe is wholesome and progressive. 

Enjoy the privacy of the secluded trailer space, or join us on the grounds or in the main house for activities and communal meals by donation.

The trailer is cozy and private, though it is rustic and quite simple. As part of our ecovillage culture, we are dedicated to living sustainably and the trailer is set up with this in mind.  

Electricity does run to the trailer. It has a heater in winter and a small AC unit for the summer months.



There is a lock on the door for your privacy and comfort. We ask a $20 deposit for the key to the lock, which we will refund to you when you return it to us at the end of your stay.

The travel trailer is not hooked up to water. Wifi does not reach to the trailer in the back of our property, but you can come to the main house to connect.

We provide a complimentary continental breakfast for you with hot tea, seasonal fruits, a variety of organic milks & cereals, organic breads, and delicious spreads like jams and nut butters in our shared dining area of our main house.

** Please Read**
Although we live in a wonderful and safe neighborhood I still take extra precautions to make sure our guest are safe and secure as possible. I have active video & audio surveillance around perimeter of home and front door entry. I can monitor activity in driveway and curbside where your car is parked and see who comes in and out of front door. Each guest will have their own separate temporary passcode to enter the premises.  I secured bedroom doors with doorlocks and provide guest with 2 keys so you can feel safe and keep your personal items secured.  I do not remake keys if guest loses a key, I install a new doorlock assembly and provide guest with a brand new key and spare.  I  placed video surveillance in hallways to prevent other guest from attempting to enter into your bedroom and prevent theft. I DO NOT place surveillance in bedrooms and bathrooms so please lock your door if you are not inside.  If you notice any suspicious activity or have personal items missing then please file a police report immediately. I will work with authorities to help resolve any issues and provide all video recordings if requested.

Please 'know' your guest you bring into the home and into the bedroom. When items come up missing it's usually from guest not really knowing their company.

"COWBOY STADIUM HOMES,LLC Corporate rentals Unit 5","This home was built in 1940.It has been remodeled but holds the charm and nostalgia with the original doors and hardwood flooring.  It is literally across the street from AT&T stadium, in the heart of the Entertainment District. Close to everything!  Check out downtown Arlington's new nightlife!  Texas Live must be seen!!!

Host will calculate additional tax for you and will message you through the Airbnb site.
Just so you are prepared, this home is prone to the noise of the stadium, so if you are a light sleeper, bring your earplugs..unless you plan to be part of it all!!

Guests have full access to the whole home with the exceptions of the garage which will remain locked.

I am usually very close as I own several homes on the street.  Outside perimeter cameras are installed that allow me to look in to ensure that all is well with the neighbors and guests are behaving according to the House Rules.

This is an older neighborhood with all homes built in the 1940s.  There are a lot of retired people and young families that live here.
PARKING:  CITY OF ARLINGTON ORDINANCE DOES NOT ALLOW ANY STREET PARKING DURING SPECIAL EVENTS.  THIS HOME HAS ENOUGH PARKING FOR 4-6 CARS STACKED IN THE DRIVEWAY.  CITY WILL TOW ANYONE PARKING ALONG THE CURB AND WILL TICKET CARS NOT PARKED ON PAVEMENT.

Walking is always an option.  Pedicabs are working when there is an event in Cowboy Stadium or Rangers Stadium.  They are fun, but you must negotiate pricing with them.  (please be fair-they work hard!)  There is an Arlington trolley that runs through the city and there is a train that goes from Dallas through Arlington to FT Worth.  There is also a visitors center next to Rangers Stadium on the corner of Randol Mill and Nolan Ryan drive. Avoid walking southwest of the home very far as there is a homeless shelter close and can lend itself to undesirables.

Get more out of your stay with the Large Family Suite!

This apartment features brand new appliances, a spacious floor plan and plenty of sleeping accommodations to keep your group comfortable!

I try to always be available to my guests by phone or through the app and even in person if needed.

Private Bedroom w/ bathroom in the middle of DFW,"Quiet & comfy Bedroom for a very relaxing and comfortable night. You’ll have a bedroom with a private bathroom and a shared living room. This home is located 25 minutes from Dallas downtown and 25 mins from Fort Worth downtown giving you the option to visit either as you please. This stay includes comfortable couches, a workspace area, and a TV in the living room. We have an available microwave, fridge, and a full kitchen for your convenience. I also stay in this home in another room.

This room gives you access to a living room, and a lounge area outside of your room where you can work, interact with others, or watch TV and enjoy a very chill night or day

I love hearing stories from all travelers and guests so if you like engaging with strangers and learning more from others then I’ll be available to talk as well.

I can also recommend good places to visit on your stay. When I came to live here 2 years ago, I didn’t know anyone so I spent a lot of time learning amazing places downtown and elsewhere to go so I’ll gladly share.

Please let me know if you have any specific requests/accommodations and I'll see what I can provide!

The neighborhood is very calm and relaxed. You will rarely hear any noise. The neighborhood is beautiful and has sidewalks where you can walk around or sit and enjoy the beautiful nature. We are close to major highways for you to go wherever you need to either in your car or using rideshare apps.

On your way, you get to enjoy the Six Flags and AT&T stadium scenery and multiple other attractions

It is a pretty easy place to get to if you are trying to use ridesharing apps and you will get one in 5min average and it is cheap to go downtown and all the other amazing places you might want to visit.",,Private room in house,Private room,Before 2021-09,Before 2022-02,United States,Texas,Arlington,76006,,"Dallas-Fort Worth-Arlington, TX",USD,19,1,2,2,,,f,moderate,,,0.0,0.0,11.0,11.0,Flexible,11:00 AM,1,32.76451,-97.07795,f,95,10,10,10,10,10,"['Air conditioning', 'Ceiling fan', 'Dryer', 'Ethernet connection', 'Essentials', 'Indoor fireplace', 'Heating', 'Hot water', 'Iron', 'Dedicated workspace', 'Laundromat nearby', 'Pocket wifi', 'Portable fans', 'TV', 'Washer', 'Wifi', 'Game console', 'Free parking on premises', 'Single level home', 'Free street parking', 'Baking sheet', 'Coffee maker', 'Cooking basics', 'Dishes and silverware', 'Dishwasher', 'Freezer', 'Kitchen', 'Microwave', 'Oven', 'Refrigerator', 'Stove', 'Cleaning before checkout', 'Luggage dropoff allowed', 'Long term stays allowed', 'Bed linens', 'Body soap', 'Conditioner', 'Extra pillows and blankets', 'Hair dryer', 'Hangers', 'Lock on bedroom door', 'Shampoo', 'Patio or balcony', 'Garden or backyard', 'Carbon monoxide alarm', 'Smoke alarm']",https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/a648f9b0-6d6b-422a-8416-a49d3a3d6d7b.jpg?aki_policy=large,,40288437,78689068,"{""allows_children"": false, ""allows_infants"": false, ""allows_pets"": false, ""allows_smoking"": false, ""allows_events"": false, ""id"": 40288437, ""host_check_in_time_message"": """", ""localized_structured_house_rules_with_tips"": null, ""p3_structured_house_rules"": [""Not suitable for children and infants"", ""No smoking"", ""No pets"", ""No parties or events""], ""structured_house_rules"": [""Not suitable for children and infants"", ""No smoking"", ""No pets"", ""No parties or events""], ""structured_house_rules_with_tips"": [{""key"": ""are_infants_and_children_allowed"", ""long_term_text"": ""May not be safe or suitable for children (0-12 years)"", ""text"": ""Not suitable for children and infants"", ""tip"": null, ""details"": null, ""airmoji_key"": ""house_rules_no_kids""}, {""key"": ""is_smoking_allowed_as_host"", ""long_term_text"": null, ""text"": ""No smoking"", ""tip"": null, ""details"": null, ""airmoji_key"": ""house_rules_no_smoking""}, {""key"": ""are_pets_allowed_as_host"", ""long_term_text"": null, ""text"": ""No pets"", ""tip"": null, ""details"": null, ""airmoji_key"": ""house_rules_no_pets""}, {""key"": ""are_events_allowed_as_host"", ""long_term_text"": null, ""text"": ""No parties or events"", ""tip"": null, ""details"": null, ""airmoji_key"": ""house_rules_no_party""}], ""allows_non_china_users"": true}",0,False,https://airbnb.com/rooms/40288437,False,,,,,,,,,,

Private Penthouse in Sustainable Community,"***30 nights minimum stay***

Our luxurious penthouse can sleep 1-16 people! It is the upstairs master suite in our main house within The Garden of Eden, a thriving community dedicated to sustainability and philanthropy!

With over 3 acres of land, herb & vegetable gardens, wildcrafted food and medicine, and a handful of residents living here, the vibe is wholesome and progressive. 

Enjoy the privacy of your room, or join us on the grounds or in the main house for communal meals by donation.

This beautiful penthouse has a number of unique and luxurious amenities! The amazing artisan floor is hand laid with decoupage paper, and painted with delicate touches. The room is decorated in a rich jewel tone kasbah style. There is a private bathroom right outside the French doors. The penthouse suite opens into the private master bathroom. We can bring in more mattresses to accommodate parties of any size. We even have one of 2 king sized beds set up in a copper pyramid!

This master suite opens to its private master bathroom with a relaxing jacuzzi hot tub, separate toilet closet, double sinks, and double shower with super hot water. These are wonderful modern amenities that only you will have access too, and  you are also welcome to sample our refreshing outdoor well shower if you wish to try our sustainable lifestyle! 

We currently have the bedroom space set up with two king sized beds - one of which is within a copper pyramid! The pyramid is a beautiful structure that is amazing for meditation, because the shape and material is a great conductor of subtle energies. 

If you have a large party, we can move in plenty of comfy mattresses to accommodate your whole group! 

There is air conditioning and heating, as well as a ceiling fan in the master bathroom for your comfort.

Free wifi is provided, along with Netflix, Disney+, Hulu, and an antenna to capture local channels. Want to have some fun off the grid? Board games are available to entertain friends and family for hours. Should you need to do laundry, you will also have access to the washer and dryer.

"2 Miles to AT&T & Rangers Stadium, Six Flags, etc","‼️‼️‼️READ READ READ EVERYTHING ON THIS LISTING AND UNDERSTAND THE FULL LISTING. MAKE SURE TO READ THE HOUSE RULES BEOFRE BOOKING AS WELL‼️‼️‼️ 
Budget friendly even on the big weeks and game weeks! This is a diamond in the rough. Located 2 Miles from all things Arlington. High-speed internet, Roku, and very quiet and comfortable. Great place for a friends going to Six Flags/Hurricane Harbor/ball games. We don’t recommend kids here. Please read below to understand why.

‼️‼️please read 1, 2, 3, 4, & 6 before booking‼️‼️

You'll have the whole unit to yourself, two bedrooms with queen mattresses, a queen built-in blow mattress, and two couches that are comfortable. Roku, Coffee, and Good times.

‼️‼️‼️‼️READ ‼️‼️‼️‼️‼️‼️‼️
1. The apartment complex on the outside isn’t great. It looks run down and we cannot control how others treat the outside of the place. We can only fix and maintain what is in the apartment. The apartment you stay in is fully renovated. 
2. The area is rough but we’ve had many people stay and love it. Look at the reviews. 
3.the bathtub has a stain because the a/c leaks from the top, there is nothing we can do even after speaking to the management company about it. 
4. Book if you’re okay with these things. We are being upfront and super honest with you. 
5. This area and the bath tub are not great but the apartment is awesome. If you can’t handle a place that’s a little rough on the outside and can’t deal with the a/c dripping into the tub then please don’t book. Yes there is a stain in the tub from the dripping. The water does not fall on you it’s at the end of the tub but again if you don’t like it, WE UNDERSTAND But do not complain when we are honest and open. 
6. We cannot control neighbors smoking weed and what they do with there time. KEEP THIS IN MIND.

Cozy Waterfront Extended-Stay Sanctuary near UTA,"We offer you a bright, cozy bedroom in our comfortable waterfront ranch home. Set in a quiet, safe, upscale neighborhood in the heart of Arlington, we're convenient to all amenities DFW has for you to enjoy. A local law limits us to hosting guests for a minimum of 30 days, so we're a perfect home-away-from-home for your business or family extended stay.

Your private room has wall-to-wall carpeting, an ample closet, a large window overlooking the spacious front lawn and garden bed, and a ceiling fan.  It is furnished with a firm single bed, a desk and office chair, a 4-drawer dresser, 2 bed-side tables, 3 lamps, and a comfortable rocking chair.... This room is only available to female guests because it shares the connected full bath (shower & tub) with your host, whose room is on the other side of the bathroom with its own access door. However, male guests may occupy this room and share the master bath across the hall if the occupant of the master suite is also male.

Your accommodations include access to all common rooms of the house -- a fully-equipped electric kitchen, free laundry room, comfortably appointed family living room with flat-screen Roku TV,  a well-shaded back yard with waterfront patio, and a front porch perfect for watching the world go by.

My hosting style is casual, like my furniture, and you are free to interact with me as much or as little as you choose. I do enjoy socializing with my guests, but I will always respect your privacy when you are home. I am never farther away than a phone call if you need assistance and happy to make suggestions about local recreation and entertainment opportunities, shopping, restaurants, and other useful resources.

"Arlington (Min From UTA, AT&T Stadium, Six Flags)","Soon to be a historic landmark for being one of the first houses ever built in Arlington! 

Located in the College Park District, this large and cozy home is perfect for those coming to town for a family day at Six Flags & Hurricane Harbor, a college visit to UTA, or to catch the Cowboys at the AT&T stadium. When you come back to unwind, you can enjoy a bottle of complimentary wine and watch your favorite show on Hulu, Netflix, or Disney+!

Please note that this property is shared with a man named Dicky who lives in a trailer behind the fence in the backyard. He's super friendly and works a lot on the yard and in his garden. 

This house has four bedrooms, two with king size beds and two with queen size beds. 3 of the bedrooms have their own Roku TV. There are two full bathrooms with shampoo, conditioner, and body wash dispensers and a hair dryer available for use. The living room has a smart TV with access to Hulu, Netflix and Disney+. The kitchen is equipped with pots, pans, cooking utensils and dishware if you feel like cooking! We also have a keurig for our coffee lovers. There is an air mattress available upon request to accommodate up to 10 guests. 

The house is renovated but is still an older house so it has its quirks. For example, some of the doors get stuck and require a little more of a push and there is an unfinished walking path made of bricks near the driveway. Please do not try to use this path.

Guest have access to all rooms in the house and the outdoor areas.

I like to provide guests with as much privacy as possible, so it is likely that we will not meet guests in person. This allows guests to enjoy the space and get their moneys worth! I am available upon request for any issues or questions!

This house is located close to all the major attractions that Arlington has to offer along with plenty of restaurants and bars.

Absolutely no smoking or vaping.
We do have a young little dog. He's very friendly and you will likely not even see him, but you may occasionally hear the pitter patter of little feet. He's otherwise pretty quiet.

The room is completely locked off from the rest of the house so you will have lots of privacy. Guests will not have access to the kitchen, but the room has its own microwave, refrigerator, and coffee maker. Long term guests may have access to the washer and dryer if needed.

Guests are welcome to sit on the patio in the chairs right by the room. The deck and fire pit are not available for guest use.

I keep to myself and will give you full privacy, but I am available if you need something.

Quiet, safe neighborhood with great highway access.

The location is close to everything! Lots of places to eat and shop within minutes of your room.

the smoke alarm is not inside the actual room, it is just on the other side of the interior door

Large and Private Stylish Downtown Apartment,"Located just 1.3 miles from AT&T Stadium this 850 square foot stylish downtown apartment is newly remodeled and has a beautifully decorated interior. Huge bathroom; living area; private entrance and outdoor space; new appliances; fast high speed Internet; walking distance from entertainment and restaurants; less than 20 minutes drive from the DFW Airport. Perfectly suited for a very relaxing stay for one person or a couple. Pet friendly space; not suitable for people with pet allergies.

The apartment is in an established residential area in downtown Arlington within blocks of entertainment, restaurants, and coffee shops— all within walking distance. It is very private, with its own outdoor space and carport. Perfect for a relaxing break for one person or a couple.

Covered porch, yard, carport.

I am available to answer questions by phone, text, or messages though the Airbnb app. I generally give people space to enjoy their stay, but I’m also very happy to answer questions and provide advice on the area as needed.

This is a very walkable neighborhood. We are two blocks from the campus of the University of Texas at Arlington, College Park Center (for basketball and other live events), three Starbucks, and four independent coffee shops. The Levitt Pavilion is two blocks away also, with a packed calendar of free outdoor music events. You can walk to many restaurants and bars from here. Dallas and Fort Worth are 25 minutes drive in opposite directions, and DFW airport is 20 minutes away. The Cowboys stadium is a little over a mile. The new Rangers stadium is about two miles. And Six Flags is two and a half miles. This is a perfect base for exploring it all, and then coming home for a stroll to dinner.

Arlington does not have public transport so a car is ideal for exploring further afield than downtown. The city has its own ride service- Via. You can walk to all the necessary locations—like restaurants and a seven eleven— from the apartment.

You can relax in your room or in the Game room upstairs!.

This room has a queen bed, office desk with a lamp and chair, walking closet, nightstand, dresser, 32"" TV (Netflix).  You have your private sink, but the bathroom will be private if the other room is not booked.

If available you can park in the driveway or outside on the street by the house.  This is a very safe neighborhood to take walks in the morning or at night time.

I'm always trying to give my guest as much privacy as possible this is why I let them use the game room upstairs to use it as an extension of their room and they can use the swimming pool during summertime.

Safe neighborhood in South Arlington.

Teeny Tiny Home!,"Reconnect with nature at this unforgettable escape in our sustainable eco village. Delight in the charm of our teeny tiny home, repurposed from a wooden shipping container and 100% upcycled materials!

Our teeny tiny homes are rustic and simple, with our highest value of sustainability in mind. They are NOT connected to electricity, but arrangements can be made to do so. We ask a $5/day donation to hook to electricity, $3/day for a fan, and $5/day for a heater. 

The teeny tiny homes do NOT come with access to our main house. 

You are welcome to use our refreshing outdoor well shower as often as you like, or may have access to the indoor hot shower for a $3 per shower donation!

The outdoor well shower pumps 55 degree water straight from the Earth! It is crisp and refreshing on a hot day, and invigoratingly brisk in any other weather. 

We have outdoor composting toilets that you are welcome to use, and we will use your ""waste"" to make EARTH!!

Wifi does not reach to the back of our property where the teeny tiny homes are located, but you are welcome to come to the back deck to connect to the wifi network or to charge your devices.

We make available a delicious, nutritious fruit basket and snacks like fresh breads, protein bars, and purified water available to all of our guests on the back deck! You can also have access to fridge space for your personal food items. 

We are similar to a hostel. You will have access to our outdoor kitchen, outdoor cooktop, and fridge space. 

Please note that we have several other spaces available for rent, including trailers, earthen homes, and indoor spaces with all your ""normal"" home amenities available for rent - please check our profile for a full listing. Our spaces range from $25-$199 per night.
